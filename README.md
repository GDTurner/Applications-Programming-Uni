# Applications-Programming-Uni

Created for MSc Computing Science module 'Applications Programming'.

This is a short MUD-style (Multi-User Dungeon) text game assigned as the primary coursework submission for the module. While the scope was broad, there were a few basic requirements and limitations. Firstly, while the use of additional libraries was not prohibited, it was discouraged - using libraries to solve problems would likely negate marks gained for solving said problems. Secondly, the game needed a save-load feature - my solution is somewhat obtuse due to using a class-based approach and the previously mentioned view on libraries. Thirdly, at least one ASCII image needed to be generated/displayed.

My submission is a short combat-led dungeon-crawler. It offers a basic character creation system, turn based, multi-ability combat. Random rolls to attack and damage, supplemented by character ability scores. An inventory system that allows for the ability to heal, equip different items or read information about items. Presistent world movement with semantic directions rather than coordinates or cardinal directions. It also provides some global commands a player can access at all times, as well as the ability to save and load a game.

Applications Programming was a module in my first semester. Having changed careers, this was my first introduction to coding and programming concepts (having never coded prior to the course), and this is the first application of any complexity I created. During this project I focussed on coding fundamentals, challenging myself to move beyond the functional programming we were taught and experiment with classes, inheritance and OOP.
