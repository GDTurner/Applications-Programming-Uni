# Applications-Programming-Uni

Created for MSc COmputing Science module 'Applications Programming'.

Applications Programming was a module in my first semester. Having changed careers, this was my first introduction to coding and programming concepts (having never coded prior to the course), and this is the first application of any complexity I created. During this project I focussed on coding fundamentals, challenging myself to move beyond the functional programming we were taught and experiment with classes, inheritance and OOP.
